# A Rails/Vue Sample CRUD Application

This is a sample Rails Application that uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios), rather than using jQuery.
This allows you to create a extremely fast and efficient Single-Page Application.

The Vue and Axios frameworks are extremely small for their capabilities and functionality. Vue also uses an extremely fast Virtual DOM, so your functionality should be fairly optimized without having to adapt to a whole different Javascript coding technique.
